# python_practice_Django
A repository working through and reviewing my knowledge in Django.

The first couple of projects I am working on are primarily working in HTML but it is to grasp the basic form and then move forward from there. I realize now that just using the concepts learned before are not enough.<b> I want to understand exactly why I am using what I am using</b>. 

I hope that my second run through Django would allow me to understand it better and utilize it. The purpose of this repository is to: 
<li>Create portoflio ready pieces.</li>
<li>Understand the inner working of back-end.</li>
<li>If possible, help along those in the same boat as I am.</li>
